This repository contains two console applications written in Java: a Calorie Counter for tracking daily calorie intake by inputting the amount of calories for each food item consumed and a Subscription Manager that reads data from a text file and helps keep track of subscription renewals by inputting the subscription name, start date, and renewal period (in days) to calculate the next renewal date.
